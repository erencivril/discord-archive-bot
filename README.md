Archive DiscordBot is a Python-based Discord bot project that is made by Eren Ã‡ivril and web interface that archives messages and attachments from a designated server, offers randomized archive replies, and generates AI-driven responses in Turkish.

- Archive text messages and attachments from specified channels.
- Random archive replies (text or attachments) with configurable probability.
- Turkish AI assistant responses via OpenRouter (configurable system prompt).
- Random AI replies with configurable probability.
- Random AI generated responses by copying the style of the archived messages.
- Support for the different AI model for the responses on mention.
- Basic voice protection: automatically remove offending roles if owner is muted/deafened/disconnected.
- Admin web dashboard (Flask) with:
  - Dashboard stats (total messages/attachments, CPU/memory usage, bot status).
  - Paginated views for messages, attachments, and application logs.
  - Bot control panel (start/stop/restart, enable/disable on boot).
  - Secure basic authentication.
